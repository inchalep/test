        <description>This no-frills burger joint in Rozelle serves up seriously good Oklahoma-style smash burgers for just $10.50 (or make it a double for $12.50)</description>
        <content:encoded><![CDATA["<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smash <a href="https://www.timeout.com/sydney/restaurants/the-best-burgers-in-sydney">burgers</a> get their name from how they&rsquo;re cooked. Beef patties are smashed onto a blazing hot grill and sizzled until golden brown. The outside ends up with a crisp, caramelised lace-like crust &ndash; the best bit about a smash burger. Eat at ROBs, located in the front window of Darling Street Meats butchery in Rozelle, specialises in Oklahoma-style smash burgers. And you're gonna wanna try them.</span></p>
<p>Eat at ROBs (short for Rozelle&rsquo;s Original Burger) was born when owner Michael Carter returned home from travelling and found a lack of good smash burger options. What began as a market stall has now grown into a burger shop with many loyal fans (including us).</p>
<p>The menu is short and simple. Choose from a grilled chicken or a smashed burger, featuring 100 per cent grass-fed beef, caramelised onion and melted cheese on a Martin&rsquo;s Potato Roll that are soft, squishy and a little bit sweet. A single cheeseburger will set you back $10.50; make it a double for $12.50, or go all out and order the combo, which comes with chips and your choice of soft drink. There are also off-menu items, like the Aussie burger, the Big Rob and loaded fries &ndash; just ask.</p>
<p>Extra toppings, like lettuce, tomato, pickles, guac, beetroot, bacon and more, are available starting at just $1. And there&rsquo;s a bunch of sauces to choose from, like ROBs mayo, tomato sauce, smoky barbecue, garlic aioli and spicy ROBs. But if it&rsquo;s your first time, we reckon you should start with the classic and add pickles, lettuce and ROBs sauce. Warning: the double may bring on a nap&mdash;speaking from experience.</p>
<p>Burger lovers, you know what to do &ndash; next stop, Rozelle.</p>

        <description>At Tiny Wombat, hidden in a secluded corner of Hills Wildlife Sanctuary, you can feed a kangaroo and cuddle a wombat, then bathe in a wood-fired hot tub under the stars</description>
        <content:encoded><![CDATA["<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gun to my head, if I were asked to recommend one Sydney staycation for an animal enthusiast visiting from overseas, I&rsquo;d tell them Tiny Wombat. Not only is this magical tiny home named after one of Australia&rsquo;s cutest native creatures, it&rsquo;s also located on one of the city&rsquo;s most incredible wildlife sanctuaries, meaning you can come face to face with some cute-as-hell Aussie animals before settling in for a hot tub under the stars. All of this, just a 45-minute drive from Sydney&rsquo;s CBD. Got family visiting from out of town and not sure where to take them? You&rsquo;re welcome.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiny Wombat is one of two tiny homes that opened earlier this year on the grounds of the Hills Wildlife Sanctuary, a lush 35-acre property on the outskirts of the city. While there are a lot of beautiful places to stay in Sydney (and even </span><a href="https://www.timeout.com/sydney/hotels/taronga-zoo-wildlife-retreat"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a hotel inside Sydney&rsquo;s most spectacular zoo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), Tiny Wombat and Tiny Wallaby are the first tiny homes to open inside an Australian wildlife sanctuary. Supported by generous donations and entirely volunteer-run, Hills Wildlife Sanctuary is an organisation dedicated to providing homes for injured or orphaned animals who might not survive in the wild. Tours of the sanctuary (offered to a limited number of visitors every week to maintain a stable setting for the animals that call it home) can be booked as an add-on to your stay, and all funds go towards keeping the sanctuary running and providing care to (cute A-F) creatures in need.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two tiny homes (operated by Into The Wild Escapes, the people responsible for operating adorable&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.timeout.com/sydney/travel/the-best-tiny-houses-and-cosy-cabins-to-rent-near-sydney"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tiny homes and cabins across NSW</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and beyond) are tucked away in quiet corners of the property, and sleep up to six guests in four comfy, linen-lined beds.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While both tiny homes feature the same amenities (super cute compact kitchens complete with fridges, hobs and crockery, outdoor tables and barbecues, huge picture frame windows opening up into the bush and magnificent wood-fired hot tubs), I&rsquo;d recommend booking Tiny Wombat for a slightly more secluded location.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We arrived at noon, and after a tour of the wildlife sanctuary (which involved feeding a friendly mob of kangaroos, stroking the resident emus and desperately trying to catch a glimpse of a sleepy wombat, who&rsquo;d cosied up in her very own cabin), we checked in to our home for the night. Despite being only a short drive from the buzz of the city, the air here is still and quiet and laced with eucalyptus.&nbsp;</span></p>
<figure id="image_8aa4f13f-c71a-c0b3-3627-f4cc796c5ba0" class="picture blog non-editable post__image"><img id="8aa4f13f-c71a-c0b3-3627-f4cc796c5ba0" class="photo lazy inline" src="https://media.timeout.com/images/106290668/image.jpg" alt="Into The Wild Escapes" data-caption="" data-credit="Photograph: Supplied | Into The Wild Escapes" data-width-class="" data-image-id="106290668" />

</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After an hour or so spent reading and drinking coffee in the bed beside the window, we picked up supplies from a grocery store nearby and hiked along a fire trail to a stunning rocky outcrop overlooking a deep, tree-studded valley. During the five kilometre walk along the beautiful leafy trail, we saw just two other groups of people: a pair of mums with their bubs exploring the bush, and an (alarmingly adventurous) elderly woman on a mountain bike. When we reached the end of the trail and watched the sun drop behind the treetops, I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel as though we were cheating the system &ndash; still within the bounds of the city, catching a perfect winter sunset and not sharing it with a soul.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we got back to the cabin, we lit the fire to warm the hot tub and shared a bottle of wine as the stars began to pierce the sky. After dinner, we lifted the lid on the tub and let a halo of steam dissipate into the air &ndash; we stayed soaking beneath the stars for over an hour, watching the silhouettes of gum leaves dance in the deep navy sky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Together, Tiny Wombat and Tiny Wallaby can sleep up to twelve guests, so you can book out both homes for a big group getaway. It&rsquo;s worth noting that two of the beds in each tiny home are bunk beds, so if you&rsquo;re booking for a group of adults, four people per cabin is probably the sweet spot.</span></p>

        <description>25hours Hotel The Olympia is due to open in the heart of Sydney&apos;s Inner East this spring â€“ complete with a lush internal garden and dreamy rooftop bar</description>
        <content:encoded><![CDATA["<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With spectacular </span><a href="https://www.timeout.com/sydney/travel/park-hyatt"><span style="font-weight: 400;">celebrity-approved palaces</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> overlooking the harbour and </span><a href="https://www.timeout.com/sydney/travel/barrenjoey-house"><span style="font-weight: 400;">magical beachside boltholes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hiding in sun-soaked coves, Sydney&rsquo;s hotel scene is already pretty unparalleled. In fact, in the most recent hotel awards from renowned travel media brand Travel and Leisure, it was revealed that </span><a href="https://www.timeout.com/sydney/news/this-beautiful-sydney-hotel-has-just-ranked-as-the-best-city-hotel-in-australia-for-2025-062625"><span style="font-weight: 400;">50 per cent of Australia&rsquo;s best city stays are right here in Sydney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But the Harbour City isn&rsquo;t stopping there. Later this year, doors will open at the first Australian outpost of 25hours Hotels. 25hours Hotel The Olympia is due to open in the heart of Sydney's Inner East this spring &ndash; here&rsquo;s what we know so far.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First things first: location, location, location. If you&rsquo;ve spent any time in the Darlinghurst/ Paddington area in recent weeks, you&rsquo;ll have seen the scaffolding begin to come down around the huge heritage-listed building on the corner of South Dowling Street and Oxford. The former theatre (initially opened in 1911 as &lsquo;West&rsquo;s Olympia Theatre&rsquo;) has spent the past few decades as a palace of entertainment, becoming Sydney&rsquo;s first twin cinema in the 1970s before briefly reverting back to a live theatre venue in 2014.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, the building will officially begin its new chapter as a hospitality mecca, with the 109-room hotel set to welcome a Santa Monica-inspired rooftop bar, a coffee shop celebrating <a href="https://www.timeout.com/sydney/restaurants/the-best-cafes-in-sydney">Sydney&rsquo;s caf&eacute; culture</a>, a sexy, film noir-inspired cocktail bar and an intimate restaurant. All four dining spaces in the hotel will be helmed by acclaimed Sydney chef Mitch Orr (the man responsible for bringing Kiln to life on the top floor of </span><a href="https://www.timeout.com/sydney/hotels/ace-hotel-sydney"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Ace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), who's taking on the role as Culinary Director in his biggest project to date. Based on Orr's track record, we've got very high hopes, and the images we've seen so far of the venue plans look pretty special.&nbsp;Alongside the foodie offerings, the hotel is also set to house a magical internal garden, a high-end retail space and super-luxe wellness facilities.</span></p>
