        <description>This no-frills burger joint in Rozelle serves up seriously good Oklahoma-style smash burgers for just $10.50 (or make it a double for $12.50)</description>
        <content:encoded><![CDATA["<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smash <a href="https://www.timeout.com/sydney/restaurants/the-best-burgers-in-sydney">burgers</a> get their name from how they&rsquo;re cooked. Beef patties are smashed onto a blazing hot grill and sizzled until golden brown. The outside ends up with a crisp, caramelised lace-like crust &ndash; the best bit about a smash burger. Eat at ROBs, located in the front window of Darling Street Meats butchery in Rozelle, specialises in Oklahoma-style smash burgers. And you're gonna wanna try them.</span></p>
<p>Eat at ROBs (short for Rozelle&rsquo;s Original Burger) was born when owner Michael Carter returned home from travelling and found a lack of good smash burger options. What began as a market stall has now grown into a burger shop with many loyal fans (including us).</p>
<p>The menu is short and simple. Choose from a grilled chicken or a smashed burger, featuring 100 per cent grass-fed beef, caramelised onion and melted cheese on a Martin&rsquo;s Potato Roll that are soft, squishy and a little bit sweet. A single cheeseburger will set you back $10.50; make it a double for $12.50, or go all out and order the combo, which comes with chips and your choice of soft drink. There are also off-menu items, like the Aussie burger, the Big Rob and loaded fries &ndash; just ask.</p>
<p>Extra toppings, like lettuce, tomato, pickles, guac, beetroot, bacon and more, are available starting at just $1. And there&rsquo;s a bunch of sauces to choose from, like ROBs mayo, tomato sauce, smoky barbecue, garlic aioli and spicy ROBs. But if it&rsquo;s your first time, we reckon you should start with the classic and add pickles, lettuce and ROBs sauce. Warning: the double may bring on a nap&mdash;speaking from experience.</p>
<p>Burger lovers, you know what to do &ndash; next stop, Rozelle.</p>
