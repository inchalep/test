				<![CDATA[ Summary: The film critic plays jury for The Nod ]]>
			</description>
			<content:encoded>
				<![CDATA[ <div><p>The year Keanu Reeves reinvented the archetypal action hero by causing a glitch in the matrix and <i>American Beauty</i> brought an entire generation to puberty was the same year that film critic Anupama Chopra first attended the Festival de Cannes. It was 1999 and Chopra couldn’t have known how popular this prestigious arthouse film festival would become in the years to come.</p><p>“This year, it felt like there were even more people, if that’s even possible,” says Chopra, who returned to Mumbai last night. “It felt that the numbers in Cannes multiplied manifold because there was no table to be got at any restaurant for lunch or dinner, and the queues were incredibly long for every screening that I attended.”</p><p>Every attendee—whether a star in a gown or the star's entourage, or the eager hands that made Cannes a hotspot for long standing ovations—will attest to the fact that <a href="https://thenodmag.com/content/indian-creatives-at-cannes-film-festival-work-culture-trend" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cannes is insanely busy</a>. “I go there for the movies, so there’s no time to relax. It’s just eight or nine days of watching everything I can from 8:30 am to however late I can last,” says Chopra, who, in 2008, was on Cannes’ coveted Un Certain Regard jury.</p><p>Here, she turns jury for <i>The Nod</i>, handpicking her favourite movies and performances, from should-have-been-blockbusters to must-be-lead actors. Scroll below for Anupama Chopra’s ultimate watch list from Cannes 2024.</p><p><img src="https://assets.thenodmag.com/website-assets/Kinds_of_Kindness_3ac3b2399e.jpg" alt="Kinds of Kindness"><div class="content-block-image-caption"><span><p>Still from 'Kinds of Kindness'</p></span></div><strong>A film that deserves a standing ovation:</strong><i>Emilia Pérez</i> by Jacques Audiard.</p><p><strong>An actor who made me cry:</strong> Smita Patil in Shyam Benegal’s <i>Manthan</i>, which showed in Cannes Classics. Her fierce talent and beauty sears the screen.</p><p><strong>An actor who made me laugh out loud:</strong> Radhika Apte in <i>Sister Midnight</i> and Jesse Plemons in <i>Kinds of Kindness</i>.</p><p><strong>A film I had a hard time sitting through:</strong> Paul Schrader’s <i>Oh, Canada!</i></p><p><strong>A debutante who won my heart:</strong> Nykiya Adams in<i> Bird</i>.</p></div><div><p><strong>A supporting actor I’d like to see in the lead:</strong> Hridhu Haroon from <i>All We Imagine as Light</i>.</p><p><strong>A movie I wish travels to Indian theatres:</strong><i>Emilia Pérez.</i></p><p><strong>A film that made my jaw drop both in a good and bad way:</strong> Francis Ford Coppola’s <i>Megalopolis</i>.</p><p><strong>An actor I want to see in lead roles more often:</strong> Shahana Goswami who is terrific as the lead in <i>Santosh</i>, which played in the Un Certain Regard section.</p><p><strong>A film that should nudge the Academy into giving an Oscar for stunts:</strong><i>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga.</i></p><p><img src="https://assets.thenodmag.com/website-assets/Mad_Max1_07653dac03.jpg" alt="Mad Max1"><div class="content-block-image-caption"><span><p>Still from 'Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga'</p></span></div><strong>A film with a distinctive visual language:</strong> Payal Kapadia's <i>All We Imagine as Light</i>, the first Indian film to be competing for the Palme d'Or at Cannes in the last 30 years, in which cinematographer Ranabir Das captures Mumbai as never before.  He locates the grim beauty, angst, and claustrophobia of Maximum City. </p><p><strong>My favourite ‘only in Cannes’ moment:</strong> At the opening night dinner, I was seated with other media correspondents. There were two empty seats at our table. About an hour later, an elegant, serious-looking gentleman came and sat next to me. I asked if he was also from the press. He said, ‘No, I’m Meryl Streep’s security.’</p><p><img src="https://assets.thenodmag.com/website-assets/Anupama_Cannes_All_We_Imagine_As_Light_3b2d2a1d7d.jpg" alt="AnupamaCannes_All We Imagine As Light"><div class="content-block-image-caption"><span><p>Still from 'All We Imagine As Light'</p></span></div><strong>My favourite Cannes memory:</strong> An emotional Juliette Binoche paying tribute, at the opening ceremony, to Meryl Streep, who was awarded an honorary Palme d’Or. At one point, the visibly moved actor look toward Streep and said, “You have changed the way we look at women.” I choked up. </p><p><strong>An actor I was thrilled to see in Cannes:</strong> Naseeruddin Shah, who made his Cannes debut after nearly 50 years of sterling films and performances.</p><p><strong>My hope for India at Cannes: </strong>That 2024 is just the start, and that each year, the hype and excitement around our cinema is bigger than that for our stars and gowns.</p></div> ]]>

				<![CDATA[ Summary: The artist known for their feminist canvases talks about their in-studio rituals, dream collaborations, and designing a stage for Glastonbury. ]]>
			</description>
			<content:encoded>
				<![CDATA[ <div><p><strong>Name:</strong> Osheen Siva</p><p><strong>Profession: </strong>Multidisciplinary artist</p><p><strong>Lives in: </strong>Goa</p><p><strong>Where you've seen their art: </strong>In <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>National Geographic</i>; in campaigns for Gucci, Apple, Meta, and Absolut; at St+art India’s Mumbai Urban Arts Festival in 2019; and Pulp Society’s exhibition for the India Art Fair in 2023, called <i>Vessel</i>.</p><p><strong>Artistic style:</strong> Otherworldly.</p></div><div><p><strong>Their work explores </strong>‘<strong>Dalit Tamil Futures</strong>’: I delve deeper into the question of belonging and what it means to be a part of a community, and my practice reflects these interrogations and growth as well. I coined the term ‘Dalit Tamil Futures’ to represent a paradigm influenced by Afro-futurism and Subaltern Futurism—both of which engage in the redefinition, reinterpretation, and reclamation of the histories of marginalised radical communities. I’d hope for the takeaway to be curiosity and inquisition on the established hierarchies in the society, inquiry on who the history is written by and what power structures are being perpetuated.</p><p><strong>A career highlight: </strong>Illustrating a stage at Glastonbury 2024. I had met and worked with the Dialled In team already as part of an art and music residency programme in Nepal last year. I happened to be in the UK earlier this year to install and take part in my solo show, Karuppu, at Bonnington Gallery, when the team reached out to me to ask me to join it in designing the Shangri-La stage at Glastonbury. I was so happy that the timing aligned seamlessly and that I was able to contribute to this historic, first-ever South Asian stage, ‘Arrivals’, at the iconic music festival.  </p><p><strong>The most challenging painting to work on: </strong>The mural that I did for <a href="https://muralfestival.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mural Festival</a> in Montreal recently was the most challenging in terms of not only the brick texture of the wall, but also its size at 40x40 ft. At the same time, it was my first wall in the North American region, so it was also exciting to be able to show [my work] to a different audience.</p></div><div><p><strong>Prized art books:</strong><i>Japanese Woodblock Prints: 1680-1900 </i>by Andreas Marks, <i>Worlds Beyond Time: Sci-Fi Art of the 1970s</i> by Adam Rowe, <i>Black Hole</i> by Charles Burns, and <i>Weird Science</i>, a comic-book series from the ’50s.</p><p><strong> An art account you should follow on Instagram:</strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/retro_scifiarts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">@retro_scifiarts</a> has some really fun and vast science fiction related references.</p><p><strong>An artist whose work more people should know: </strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/jaisingh_na/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jaisingh Nageswaran,</a> a self-taught photographer from Tamil Nadu.</p><p><strong>Advice to beat a creative block: </strong>Step out, meet other humans, do what you love outside of your art practice, and definitely get off the internet.</p><p><strong>Most unusual creative influence:</strong> I have early memories of visiting aquariums and planetariums and remember how they blew my mind in terms of the intricacies and vibrancy of the universe.</p><p><strong>In-studio rituals:</strong> Coffee, midday naps, history podcasts while painting, and dog-petting breaks in between. </p><p><strong>Go-to brand(s) for art supplies: </strong>Fabriano or Arches, but I’m not too picky about brands. </p><p><strong>Artists whose work more people should collect:</strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/srujangatha/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shrujana Shridhar</a>, <a href="https://amp.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/mar/05/soufiane-ababri-moroccan-art-star-bed" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Soufiane Ababri</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/naqvi_sarah/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rah Naqvi</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chashmishkahiki/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rithika Pandey</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jamesjeanart/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">James Jean</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the_world_of_nabi/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The World of Nabi</a>.</p><p><strong>You probably didn’t know that: </strong>Most of my tattoos are my artworks.</p><p><strong>A dream collaboration:</strong> Erykah Badu.</p></div> ]]>

			<title>Arooj Aftab is the new poster child for sad girl music</title>

				<![CDATA[ Summary: Pop girl summer be gone, we are yearning for melancholic, introspective, emo songs this season ]]>
			</description>
			<content:encoded>
				<![CDATA[ <div><p>From a rustling meadow of acoustic guitar notes emerges Arooj Aftab’s sonorous voice. “Aey nahin abhi tak/ koi baat ho gayi,” intones the Brooklyn-via-Lahore musician in the first song from her new record, <i>Night Reign</i>. “Shayad unke sheher mein/ achanak raat ho gayi,” she goes on. Is it a song about the anxiety of waiting, or the eagerness to offer one’s beloved the benefit of doubt? The subtext might be open to interpretation, but the tone isn’t. ‘Aey Nahin’ takes an Instagram post by Aftab’s friend, Pakistani actor and writer Yasra Rizvi, and transforms it into a pop-jazz meditation. From its very first note, Aftab does what she does best: set that half-moon-scented-night mood. </p><p>Like the critically acclaimed <i>Vulture Prince</i>, Aftab’s breakthrough album of 2021, <i>Night Reign</i> is yet another demonstration of the Grammy-winning musician’s complete mastery of jazz composition and music engineering, her eye for unexpected but fitting collaborators, and her world-melding vision of globally resonant music. The album is full of gorgeous, introspective verse that hops across centuries and geographical coordinates—there’s poetry from Mah Laqa Bai Chanda, one of the rare women to be published in the 18th century, as well as Rumi and 20th-century French poet Jacques Prévert. But where <i>Vulture Prince</i> was marked overtly by grief (the death of Aftab’s brother precipitated and shaped its songs), <i>Night Reign</i> is a brighter, more hopeful work. </p><p>“<i>Vulture Prince</i> was a sad record because I was sad,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/13/arts/music/arooj-aftab-night-reign.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Aftab told <i>The New York Times</i></a>. “But in the years that passed, I’ve had this joy inside of me. It would be unfair if it didn’t translate in my music.” And it does, to the extent that a mash of jazz and ghazals (both forms given to melancholy) can do. Which is to say, if ‘sad girl music’ is your jam, Aftab’s new record, indeed her whole body of work, would fit easily on your playlists. </p><p>Like many artists, Aftab resists labels. What creative person would like to be reduced to a single type, a genre, representative of one ‘exotic’ culture, to cater to one imaginary market? If nomenclatures like world music and fusion have had the global South up in arms for decades, the subgenre of sad girl music has seen growing criticism as it has re-emerged in the <a href="https://thenodmag.com/tag/tiktok" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TikTok</a> era. </p><p>Even before TikTok gave it a buzzy name, sad girl music (SGM) had been around us for decades really. A catchall (derisive) phrase for (mostly) guitar-toting female singer-songwriters who make emotional music, SGM’s trademark can be seen in the music of Billie Holiday in the 1950s, Nico in the 1960s, Fiona Apple in the 1990s, Lana Del Ray from the 2010s onwards, now joined by Billie Eilish, Phoebe Bridgers, and Mitski. </p><p>Absolutely none of them appreciate being slotted into this category, but sad girl is a mood—and in the social media era, there are sad girl <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frhjdr7zUqc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">makeup tutorials</a>, even a sad girl starter pack playlist on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWW2hj3ZtMbuO" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spotify</a> and its cousin on the spectrum of sadness, pioneered by an anime girl on YouTube called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LofiGirl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lofi Girl</a>.</p></div><div><p>Given the rather universal nature of the ‘female condition’—indeed, of blueness borne of longing, heartbreak, and discontent—it can seem odd that a lot of the subculture is focused on white adolescent girls and young adults. This is another major criticism of mainstream SGM: for a long time, it hasn’t included the voices and faces, minds and bodies of colour. </p><p>But consider the ghazals of Iqbal Bano and Farida Khanum, and the thumris of Shobha Gurtu, Naina Devi, and Vidya Rao and more. There are centuries of poignant Urdu and Hindustani verse about heartbreak, longing, and the vulnerability of devotion and desire, and these have also informed decades of mainstream <a href="https://thenodmag.com/tag/bollywood" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bollywood</a> film and music. Listen to Begum Akhtar’s voice crack on the classic ‘Ae Mohabbat Tere Anjaam Pe Rona Aya’, but also find the lo-fi flip version (there’s a whole album of them).</p><p>Consider the more introspective storytellers among our contemporary singer-songwriters to tap into the very specific feeling of growing up as a young woman in the 21st century. Ditty, or Aditi Veena, wrestles with selfhood in ‘Home In My Skin’ from her latest EP, <i>Skin</i>. “For I’ve been running away/ for too long, from myself/ and I have treated her like a shell,” she recites, against a background of morose cello strains. Electronic music producer Tarana Marwah, who goes by the stage name Komorebi, takes on bullies in ‘Better Not Bitter’, the final track on her 2023 EP <i>The Fall</i>. “You wear your damages like armour,” she repeats, tiredness seeping through her voice that floats over Sahil Vasudeva’s gentle piano notes. </p><p>Sikkim-bred singer-songwriter Anoushka Maskey channels her folk melodies in the subdued number ‘The Search for Wild Geese’: “Darling I fear I’ll always be alone/ I’ll never run out of lines but it just/ seems all too strung out,” she sings in a melody overwhelmed with nostalgia and loneliness. In her pandemic-era track, ‘Bored As Fuck’, Delhi’s Hanita Bhambri muses on much the same: “Thoughts flood my head/ I’m in a black hole/ anger aches my bones…”  And in her punk-esque 2021 single ‘End of the World’, Mumbai-based Alisha Batth, through jangling electric guitar, croons “I cry and I get high/ and I don’t see why that’s a terrible thing/ when my body keeps telling me it’s cold, without you to hold.”</p><p>Going back to Aftab’s <i>Night Reign</i>, think of Mah Laqa Chanda Bai, whom I spoke of earlier. An 18th-century courtesan from Hyderabad, she was also a noblewoman and a warrior, as well as the <a href="https://www.rekhta.org/poets/mah-laqa-chanda/profile" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">first woman to publish</a> a Diwan, or collection of Urdu ghazals, in 1798. Her verse, which won her favours from nawabs centuries ago, now forms the basis of two songs in <i>Night Reign</i>: ‘Saaqi’ and ‘Na Gul’. Both are imbued with the sort of comfortable forlornness many of us seek in solitary moments.</p><p>In her seminal book, <i>The Second Sex</i>, Simone de Beauvoir wrote that “the drama of women” stems from the realisation “that she—a free and autonomous being like all human creatures—nevertheless finds herself living in a world where men compel her to assume the status of the Other.” Sure, to create a label might also be doing something similarly dark. But labels notwithstanding, the music will be written, produced, sung and consumed. Because, if you listen closely to these great singer-songwriters, there is solidarity in discomfort, catharsis, and even a ray of hope beaming into the void.</p></div> ]]>
